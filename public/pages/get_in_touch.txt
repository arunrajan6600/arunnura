You can find ARM processors everywhere. More than 10 billion ARM processor based devices had been manufactured by the end of 2008. At the end of 2013, over 52 billion ARM processors had been shipped. It is likely that readers of this book own at least one product containing ARM processor based devices - a mobile phone, tablet device, personal computer, television or even a car. It might come as a surprise to programmers more used to the personal computer to learn that the highly successful x86 architecture occupies a much smaller position in terms of total microprocessor shipments, with over three billion devices.

The ARM architecture has advanced significantly since the first ARM1 silicon in 1985. ARM produces a whole family of processors that share common instruction sets and programmer's models and have some degree of backward compatibility.

Let's begin, however, with a brief look at the history of ARM.
